# aptamerbase

Aptamers are single-stranded nucleic acid or amino acid polymers that recognize and bind to targets with high affinity and selectivity. The Aptamer Base is a database of detailed, structured information about the experimental conditions under which aptamers were selected and their binding affinity quantified. Details regarding the aptamerbase can be found in the associated article (http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3308162/)

The database was initially developed using freebase, which was subsequently acquired by Google, and shut down in 2016. We extracted the aptamerbase from the freebase RDF dump, and these are now available in the data directory.
